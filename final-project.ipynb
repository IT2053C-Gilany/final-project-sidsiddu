    "\n",
    "> I selected this dataset because I work in the automotive business and I’m genuinely interested in understanding how different car specifications (engine size, horsepower, MPG, curb weight) affect overall pricing and performance. This dataset lets me analyze real automotive trends using statistical insights and visualizations. It also gives me a chance to explore relationships that actually matter in real-world car buying, selling, and dealership operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    ">- How does engine size relate to the price of a car? \n",
    ">- Does a bigger engine always mean a higher price?\n",
    ">- Is there a relationship between horsepower and city/highway MPG? \n",
    ">- Do more powerful cars always use more fuel?\n",
    ">- What car body styles tend to have the highest prices?\n",
    ">- How do curb weight and engine size together affect fuel efficiency?\n",
    ">- Which manufacturer has the most expensive average vehicles?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the questions above, I plan to create the following visualizations:\n",
    "> Scatter Plot: Engine Size vs Price\n",
    "   - Shows how engine displacement impacts vehicle price.\n",
    ">\tRegression Plot: Horsepower vs City/Highway MPG\n",
    "   - Shows the negative correlation between power and fuel efficiency.\n",
    ">\tBar Chart: Average Price by Body Style\n",
    "   - Compares sedans, hatchbacks, convertibles, etc.\n",
    ">\tDistribution Plot: Vehicle Prices\n",
    "   - Understands how prices are spread across the dataset.\n",
    ">\tGrouped Bar Chart: Fuel Type vs Average Horsepower\n",
    "   - Shows the performance difference between gas and diesel engines.\n",
    ">\tBox Plot: Car Price Distribution by Manufacturer\n",
    "   - Helps visualize which brands are more expensive.\n",
    ">\tHeatmap: Correlation Matrix of Numerical Variables\n",
    "   - Shows relationships between horsepower, engine size, weight, MPG, and price.\n",
    ">\tPie Chart: Vehicle Count by Body Style\n",
    "   - Shows market share of each style in the dataset.\n"
